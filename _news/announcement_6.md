At the start of 2024, I will begin a new role as a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Yonsei University's](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/) [Seamless Transportation Lab](http://stl.yonsei.ac.kr). Under the guidance of Prof. Shiho Kim, I'll be working on new challenges of intelligent vehicles and smart mobility.
