I'm a Ph.D. Student who currently working on a TUBITAK research project at [Computer Vision Research Group - CVRG](http://cvrg.iyte.edu.tr) - [Izmir Institute of Technology](http://www.iyte.edu.tr/) in Izmir.
My work interests: AI, ML, Computer vision, Behaviour prediction and Data visualization. 
  
About personal info,
I love reading about psychology, sociology, neuroscience, philosophy.
As you can understand, [GEB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) is like a holy book for me!
And I've a new hobby these days "analog photography". It's like looking at this modern world

> “To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair.
> The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed.
> The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
> The hate of men will pass, and dictators die.
> And the power they took from the people will return to the people.
> And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.
> Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men.
> Machine men with machine minds and machine hearts!
> You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men!
> You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful.
> To make this life a wonderful adventure.
> Let us use that power!
> Let us all unite!.”
