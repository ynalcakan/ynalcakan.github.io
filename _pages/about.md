I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at [Yonsei University's](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/) [Seamless Transportation Lab (STL)](http://stl.yonsei.ac.kr/). I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science from the [Izmir Institute of Technology](https://en.iyte.edu.tr/), under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Yalin Bastanlar](https://ceng.iyte.edu.tr/people/yalin-bastanlar/). My doctoral research focused on vehicle maneuver detection for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). During my Ph.D., I had the opportunity to spend a term as a visiting research scholar at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/)'s Vehicle Dynamics and Control Laboratory ([VDCL](https://vdcl.snu.ac.kr/)) & the Future Mobility Technology Center ([FMTC](https://fmtc.snu.ac.kr/)) supported by a research scholarship from TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey).

My current research interests revolve around computer vision and deep learning, with a specialization in multispectral camera systems, perception in adverse weather scenarios, representation learning, and vision-language modeling.
