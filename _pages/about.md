I'm a Ph.D. researcher and teaching assistant in the [Computer Engineering Department](https://ceng.iyte.edu.tr/) at [Izmir Institute of Technology](https://en.iyte.edu.tr/). I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science from the same institution, under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Yalin Bastanlar](https://ceng.iyte.edu.tr/people/yalin-bastanlar/). My doctoral research focused on vehicle maneuver detection for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). During my Ph.D., I had the opportunity to spend a term as a visiting research scholar at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/)'s Vehicle Dynamics and Control Laboratory ([VDCL](https://vdcl.snu.ac.kr/)) & the Future Mobility Technology Center ([FMTC](https://fmtc.snu.ac.kr/)) supported by a research scholarship from TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey).
My research interests lie in the fields of computer vision and deep learning. Specifically, I specialize in developing deep learning and computer vision-based solutions for predicting the behavior of traffic users.

About personal info,
I love reading about psychology, sociology, neuroscience, philosophy. As you can understand, Douglas Hofstadter's masterpiece: 'Gödel, Escher, Bach' ([GEB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach)) is like a holy book for me. I've recently taken up a captivating hobby: analog photography. It's a form of art that allows me to perceive our modern world through a vintage lens, capturing moments in time that evoke a sense of [nostalgia](http://www.flickr.com/106092908@N08).

> “To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair.
> The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed.
> The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
> The hate of men will pass, and dictators die.
> And the power they took from the people will return to the people.
> And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.
> Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men.
> Machine men with machine minds and machine hearts!
> You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men!
> You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful.
> To make this life a wonderful adventure.
> Let us use that power!
> Let us all unite!.”
> ― Charlie Chaplin - From the movie The Great Dictator
